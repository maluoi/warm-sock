# warm-sock
A single header socket/networking library for building server/client multi-user experiences.

Still in development, more info to follow! This is designed to be the networking component of [StereoKit](https://stereokit.net), so it needs to be able to handle networking scenarios common to shared Mixed Reality experiences.

Check out example.cpp for usage!
